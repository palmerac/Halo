# Halo Infinte Stat Dashboard

original csv was obtained from https://leafapp.co  
dashboard is a work in progress and at [streamlit](https://palmerac-halo.streamlit.app) 

halo.ipynb - stats since the start of bandit season, df.csv
haloNS.ipynb - since MMR reset ~(Feb 3, 2024), dfNS.csv
haloModels.ipynb - forked from Tennis ML models and updated to predict Win/Loss, work in progress dont think values are working right

matchhistory-old.csv - an outdated format of the original csv, new one has more info
scorigami.csv - list of the scorigami values that are duplicates (happened more than once)
requirements.txt - requirements for streamlit website

Plots are fairly self explanatory
